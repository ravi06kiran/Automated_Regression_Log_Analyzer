# Automated Regression Log Analyzer

## 🚀 Overview
A robust automation tool developed to streamline the verification process by parsing large-scale simulation logs. This tool identifies failure signatures, categorizes errors (Timing Violations, Functional Failures), and generates automated triage reports. It is designed to mimic industrial regression environments, significantly reducing manual debugging time.

## 🔑 Key Features
* **Automated Log Parsing:** Capable of processing **1,000+ simulation logs** in a single run using **Python** and **Perl** scripting.
* **Smart Triage:** Implements RegEx-based pattern matching to detect and classify errors, reducing manual debug triage time by **40%**.
* **Performance Optimization:** Utilizes **C++** concepts for efficient data handling and processing speed.
* **Randomized Testing:** Includes a module to generate randomized test patterns, simulating real-world hardware error scenarios to validate tool robustness (increased by **25%**).

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
* **Languages:** Python 3.x, Perl, C++ (Algorithms).
* **Libraries:** `re` (Regex), `pandas` (Data Analysis), `random` (Test Generation).
* **OS:** Linux/Unix, Windows.

## 📊 Results
* Successfully automated the failure analysis of regression suites.
* Improved verification efficiency by eliminating manual log inspection.
* Generated HTML/Text summary reports for quick root-cause analysis.
